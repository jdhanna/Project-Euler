# Project Euler
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) is an online collection of numerical math/computing problems with interesting/quick solutions. It is an excellent source of recreational mathematics/coding challenges. 

I've put together solutions for several of these Euler problems in python. Each solution in the first 50 should run in under a minute on most PCs, but I make no guarantees about later problems.
