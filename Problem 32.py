# Problem 32: https://projecteuler.net/problem=32
# The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
# Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

# Solution: Brute force works fine here. We know we'll never need to check a 5 digit product since it would require more than 9 digits to create.
